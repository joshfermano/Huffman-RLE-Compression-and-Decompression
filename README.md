# Huffman-RLE-Compression-and-Decompression
This project implements a file compression and decompression system using two algorithms: Huffman Coding and Run Length Encoding (RLE). The goal is to compress text files efficiently and allow them to be decompressed back to their original state. The program is built in C++.
